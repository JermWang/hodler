AMPLIFI — MASTER PRODUCT & MIGRATION SPEC
0. One-line definition (lock this everywhere)

AmpliFi is a creator growth protocol that automatically pays token holders for organic marketing activity, verified by onchain ownership and social engagement.

“Turn holders into your marketing engine.”

This sentence replaces all Commit to Ship positioning.

1. Core Mental Model (important for copy + UX)
Commit to Ship

Problem: creators don’t deliver

Mechanism: escrow + milestones

Incentive: ship to get paid

AmpliFi

Problem: creators can’t market effectively

Mechanism: fee split + engagement verification

Incentive: talk to get paid

DO NOT reference:

milestones

delivery

shipping

escrow logic in UI copy

DO reference:

amplification

signal

participation

contribution

distribution

2. Roles & Actors (renamed cleanly)
Commit to Ship	AmpliFi
Creator	Project
Backer	Holder
Milestone	Epoch
Escrow	Reward Pool
Claim funds	Claim rewards

These terms must be globally replaced in UI, API responses, and docs.

3. Core System Architecture (logic stays, semantics change)
What stays the same (IMPORTANT)

You are not rewriting the app, you’re re-framing it.

Wallet verification flow

Signature-based ownership proof

Claimable balances

Epoch-based settlement

Admin / creator dashboards

Onchain transparency assumptions

What changes

Inputs that unlock payouts

Scoring logic

Copy + intent

4. AmpliFi Core Flow (MVP)
4.1 Project Creation

Projects configure an Amplification Campaign:

Required fields:

Token mint address

Campaign start / end

Minimum holder balance

Fee paid by project

Optional:

Engagement weighting (likes / RTs / replies)

Epoch duration (daily / weekly)

4.2 Fee Split (hard rule)

50% → AmpliFi platform

50% → Holder Reward Pool

This split should be visible everywhere (trust lever).

4.3 Holder Onboarding

To participate, a user must:

Connect wallet

Verify token balance

Connect social account (X/Twitter first)

Opt into campaign

UX copy should emphasize:

“You only earn if you actually contribute.”

4.4 Engagement Tracking

Track only public, verifiable actions:

Replies

Quote tweets

Retweets

Likes (lowest weight)

Requirements:

Must reference project (handle, link, or keyword)

Must occur during active epoch

4.5 Scoring Engine (abstract, v1)

Score =

Engagement × Balance Weight × Anti-Spam Modifier


Notes:

Balance weight should be non-linear (sqrt/log)

Cap per epoch to avoid farming

Prefer sustained activity > bursts

This logic lives server-side and is opaque in UI (show totals, not formula).

4.6 Distribution & Claims

Rewards accrue during epoch

Claimable after epoch ends

Claims are transparent, auditable

Rename:

“Claim escrow” → Claim rewards

“Milestone complete” → Epoch settled

5. UI / UX Structure (mapped from Commit to Ship)
Pages to Keep (renamed)

/discover → Explore Campaigns

/project/:id → Campaign Page

/dashboard → Creator Dashboard

/claims → Rewards

Campaign Page Sections

Campaign overview

Reward pool size

Epoch countdown

Participation requirements

User’s current contribution score

Claim status

6. Branding System (lock this)
Name

AmpliFi

Capitalization:

Brand: AmpliFi

App copy: AmpliFi

Token references: project-specific only

Logo Usage Rules

Primary: A-shaped amplification glyph

Must work in pure black & white

No gradients in base mark

Icon-first brand (text optional)

Favicon, PFP, app icon all use glyph only.

Visual Language

Bold, confident, minimal

Avoid “marketing speak”

Avoid influencer vibes

Feels like infrastructure, not social media

7. Copy Rewrite Guide (critical)
Remove these words everywhere:

ship

deliver

milestone

accountability

escrow

roadmap

Replace with:

amplify

signal

participation

contribution

distribution

rewards

Example:

“Funds are released after milestones are completed”
→
“Rewards are distributed after each amplification epoch.”

8. API / Backend Renames (no logic changes)

Rename endpoints and fields only:

milestone_id → epoch_id

escrow_balance → reward_pool_balance

completed_at → settled_at

Keep schema identical where possible to avoid migrations.

9. Legal / Safety Notes (lightweight)

No guarantee of rewards

Rewards tied to verified public activity

Platform does not endorse content

Social APIs are best-effort

This should live in Terms, not UI.

10. Migration Checklist (use this literally)
Phase 1 — Internal

Duplicate Commit to Ship repo

Rename product strings

Swap icons + logo

Update routes & nav labels

Phase 2 — Functional

Disable milestone UI

Enable engagement scoring

Enable epoch settlement

Phase 3 — Public

Launch AmpliFi landing

Archive Commit to Ship (read-only)

Redirect traffic

11. One-sentence positioning for launch

AmpliFi pays your holders to amplify your project — automatically.

That’s it. No more explanation needed.
