Core Value Proposition
For Creators / Projects

Built-in marketing army

Only pay for real engagement

No influencer negotiations

Fees convert directly into reach

For Holders

Earn yield without selling

Get paid for doing what they already do

Rewards scale with:

holdings

effort

quality of engagement

For the Platform

50% rake on creator fees

Viral growth loop

Extremely sticky user behavior

Core Flow (User Mental Model)
1. Creator launches / registers project

Pays creator fees (same mental model as Commit to Ship)

Chooses:

campaign duration

minimum holding requirement

reward weighting (RT vs likes vs replies)

2. Holder opts in

To participate, holder must:

✅ Verify wallet (token balance snapshot)

✅ Verify Twitter/X account

✅ Link wallet ↔ Twitter (1:1)

This opt-in step is critical for sybil resistance.

3. Holder posts organically

They post:

Tweets

Retweets

Replies

Quote tweets

ONLY counted if they include:

project handle OR

campaign hashtag OR

campaign URL

4. Activity is tracked & scored

Each action produces Engagement Points (EP).

Example scoring (tunable):

Action	Base EP
Like	1
Retweet	3
Reply	5
Quote Tweet	6

Then multipliers apply 👇

Reward Formula (Important Part)
Final Score =
Engagement Points
× Holder Balance Weight
× Time Consistency Bonus
× Anti-Spam Dampener

Holder Balance Weight

Square root or log-scaled
(prevents whales from nuking distribution)

Example:

weight = sqrt(holder_tokens / total_tokens)

Time Consistency Bonus

Rewards sustained effort over spam bursts:

Posting across multiple days > posting 20 tweets in 1 hour

Anti-Spam Dampener

Automatically reduces rewards if:

duplicate phrasing

AI-generated boilerplate

excessive frequency

reply spam

(you don’t need perfect NLP—basic heuristics go a long way)

Fee Split Mechanics
Creator Fees (100%)

50% → Platform Treasury

50% → Holder Reward Pool

Holder pool is:

streamed daily or weekly

claimable via dashboard

transparent ledger (your specialty)

Distribution Timing Options

Creators can choose:

Real-time accrual (daily claimable)

Epoch-based (weekly settlement)

Milestone-based (unlock after campaign KPIs)

You already solved this mentally with escrow → just flip the direction.

Abuse & Sybil Resistance (Critical)

Here’s why this won’t get farmed instantly if done right:

Hard Requirements

One Twitter ↔ one wallet

Minimum holding threshold

Cooldown on posting rewards

Engagement must reference the project

Soft Enforcement

Diminishing returns on repetitive posts

Low value for likes only

Replies weighted more than RTs

Shadow-ban obvious farms (quietly)

This doesn’t need perfection—good enough beats nothing.

What You’re Actually Building (Tech POV)

This is very doable for you in 1–2 days MVP:

Backend

Wallet verification (you already have this)

Token balance snapshot

Twitter/X API (read-only engagement tracking)

Scoring engine

Distribution ledger

Frontend

Creator dashboard (campaign config)

Holder dashboard:

verified status

activity score

pending rewards

claim button

Infra

Index Twitter activity async

Cache scores

Finalize payouts per epoch

This is simpler than Commit to Ship in many ways.

Why This Is Actually Big

This quietly solves:

“airdrops don’t work”

“KOLs are expensive”

“holders don’t help price”

“marketing feels fake”

You’re replacing:

pay influencers upfront

with:

pay believers after effort
